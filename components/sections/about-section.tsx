            I’m Harshit — a selenophile and builder who blends curiosity with disciplined product thinking. The moon’s
            calm precision inspires my approach: clear strategy, considered experimentation, and execution that shines
            when it matters.

            I lead AI-driven initiatives with user empathy, aligning business outcomes with delightful experiences. I
            believe great products are navigated like the night sky—anchored by principles, guided by patterns, and
            always exploring the edges.
